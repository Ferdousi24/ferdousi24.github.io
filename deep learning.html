        <h1>Project Description</h1>
        <p>As part of my internship in the Department of Geography, Environment, and Geomatics at the University of Ottawa, I worked on a project using the U-Net architecture for binary image segmentation. This deep learning model was employed to differentiate squirrel images based on color, specifically focusing on black and brown color variants.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
        <ul>
        </h2> Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing </h2>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Collection: Collected 500 images of squirrels.</li>
                    <li>Masking: Applied masking techniques using OpenCV to create binary masks for the images. This involved using threshold values to segment the squirrels from the background.</li>
                    <li>Preprocessing: Conducted preprocessing steps to enhance the dataset quality. This included resizing images to a consistent size, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting data to improve model robustness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        
            <li>Model Implementation:
                <ul>
                    <li>Utilized the U-Net architecture to develop a model that accurately identifies and segments squirrels across various backgrounds.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        
            <li>Segmentation:
                <ul>
                    <li>Loss Function: Used an appropriate loss function for binary segmentation, such as binary cross-entropy.</li>
                    <li>Evaluation: Monitored performance metrics like accuracy and Intersection over Union (IoU) to assess the model's effectiveness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
