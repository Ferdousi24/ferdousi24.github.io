    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p> As part of my internship in the Department of Geography, Environment, and Geomatics at the University of Ottawa, I worked on a project utilizing the U-Net architecture for image segmentation. This deep learning model, designed specifically for semantic segmentation tasks, was used to differentiate squirrel images based on color, with a focus on black, brown, and other color variants.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dataset Preparation: Collected, masked, and preprocessed a dataset of squirrel images, categorized by colors.</li>
        <li>Model Implementation: Utilized the U-Net architecture to develop a model that accurately identifies and segments squirrels across various backgrounds.</li>
        <li>Segmentation: Used the trained model .</li>
    </ul>
