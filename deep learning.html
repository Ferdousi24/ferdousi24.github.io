    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p> As part of my internship in the Department of Geography, Environment, and Geomatics at the University of Ottawa, I worked on a project using the U-Net architecture for binary image segmentation. This deep learning model was employed to differentiate squirrel images based on color, specifically focusing on black and brown color variants.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing:
            <ul>
                <li>Data Collection: Collected 500 images of squirrels.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Masking: Applied masking techniques using OpenCV to create binary masks for the images. This involved using threshold values to segment the squirrels from the background.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Preprocessing: Conducted preprocessing steps to enhance the dataset quality. This included resizing images to a consistent size, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting data to improve model robustness.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>Model Implementation:
            <ul>
                <li>Utilized the U-Net architecture to develop a model that accurately identifies and segments squirrels across various backgrounds.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>Segmentation:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Loss Function: Used an appropriate loss function for binary segmentation, such as binary cross-entropy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Evaluation: Monitored performance metrics like accuracy and Intersection over Union (IoU) to assess the model's effectiveness.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
