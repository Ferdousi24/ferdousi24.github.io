    <title>Web Mapping Project: Libraries Open at Noon</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p> I developed this as part of my course on Real-Time GIS in LinkedIn Learning. </p>
    
    <h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1.Data preparation and processing in ArcGIS Pro:
            After downloading and inspecting the data, I identified and structured the libraries in the city that open at noon and imported them into a mobile database system. Once the feature dataset was reprojected, I exported it in JSON format for GIS integration.</li>
        <p> </p>
        </li> 2. Web Map Development:
            Published the processed dataset as a web map using ArcGIS Online.
            Configured symbology, labels, and pop-ups for better visualization.</li>
        <p> </p>
         3. Web Mapping Application:
            Developed an interactive web mapping application using ArcGIS Instant App
            Added functionalities like filtering, searching, and user-friendly navigation.
