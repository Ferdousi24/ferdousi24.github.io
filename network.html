    <title>Vehicle Routing Optimization for GHG Reduction</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Project Description:</h1>
    <p> As part of my learning in the "GIS for Climate Action" course by ESRI, I conducted network analysis to optimize vehicle routes for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p>
        
    <h2>Data and Tools:</h2>
        <li> Customers order data (provided as part of the exercise) .</li>
            <li> GIS Software (ArcGIS Pro)</li>
                <li> Network Analysis tools.</li>
   
        <h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1. Extracted location data using the ArcGIS geocoding tool.</li>
        <p> </p>
        </li> 2. Utilized a vehicle routing problem (VRP) layer, defining depots and orders, and adding routing details
       </li>
        <p> </p>
        Constraints: Although the analysis was halted at the end due to limit crossing restrictions, I gained practical experience in network analysis.</li>
        <p> </p>
        <h2>Key learning:</h2>
        <ul>
             GIS Skills:  I gained valuable experience with GIS tools, network analysis </li>
        <p> </p>
