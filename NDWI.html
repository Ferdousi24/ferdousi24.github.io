        <h1>NDWI-Based Water Body Analysis in Ottawa Using Google Earth Engine</h1>
    
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong>  
        This project applies the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to analyze and visualize surface water bodies in <strong>Ottawa, Ontario</strong>, using cloud-based satellite imagery processing in <strong>Google Earth Engine (GEE)</strong>. The project demonstrates how Earth observation data can be effectively used to support hydrological studies, urban planning, and environmental monitoring.</p>
    
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Detect and delineate water bodies within the Ottawa region using Sentinel-2 imagery.</li>
            <li>Enhance understanding of remote sensing indices and geospatial image processing.</li>
            <li>Explore the capabilities of Google Earth Engine for real-time spatial analysis.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Source:</strong> Sentinel-2 MSI Level-1C imagery, selected for high spatial resolution and multispectral coverage.</li>
            <li><strong>Index Used:</strong> <strong>NDWI = (Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR)</strong>, designed to enhance the presence of water by contrasting reflectance in the green (Band 3) and near-infrared (Band 8) spectral bands.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform & Tools:</strong> Google Earth Engine (JavaScript API) for cloud-based processing, map visualization, and threshold-based classification of water features.</li>
            <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> Filtered by cloud cover and date range to ensure data quality and seasonal clarity (e.g., summer months for maximum water visibility).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            The analysis successfully highlighted various surface water features across the city, NDWI values were used to create a binary water mask, where water pixels were isolated based on a defined threshold (e.g., NDWI > 0.2). The resulting map provides a clear and accurate spatial distribution of water bodies within the study area.
        </p>
        
    
    
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This project showcases the potential of remote sensing and cloud-based geospatial platforms in environmental research. By leveraging NDWI and Sentinel-2 data, it was possible to effectively identify water bodies and support data-driven decision-making. The project also strengthened my skills in Earth Engine scripting, satellite image interpretation, and spatial analysis.
