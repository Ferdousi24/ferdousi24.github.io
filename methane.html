    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p>  â€œGeospatial Analysis to Explore Methane Concentration Trends " was a project completed as part of the "Seminar for Geomatics" course during my exchange program at Carleton University. The project aimed to determine how methane concentration changes over the year and to identify the months with the highest concentration in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. </p>
