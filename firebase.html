    <h1>Squirrel Sightings Tracker Using Firebase and Python</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project involves the development of a lightweight Python application that collects and uploads wildlife observation data — specifically squirrel sightings — to a cloud-based Firebase Realtime Database. Each observation includes species name, fur color, and geolocation (latitude and longitude). The project simulates a real-world use case where wildlife data is collected in the field and automatically stored in a centralized, cloud-accessible platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core objective was to explore how cloud databases can be used in geospatial workflows to manage spatial and attribute data efficiently. Firebase was used for its real-time data syncing capabilities, while the Firebase Admin SDK in Python enabled secure, authenticated data transactions.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Database Setup:</strong> Configured Firebase Realtime Database to accept structured wildlife observation data.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Implemented secure access using service account credentials via Firebase Admin SDK.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Structuring:</strong> Designed a consistent schema using JSON format to store species details, colors, and geolocation points.</li>
      <li><strong>Scripting:</strong> Developed Python code to automate the process of generating and uploading squirrel sighting records.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firebase Fundamentals:</strong> Gained hands-on experience with setting up and managing a cloud NoSQL database, and connecting it to Python-based applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure API Integration:</strong> Learned how to authenticate scripts and securely manage sensitive credentials for cloud services.</li>
      <li><strong>Practical Geospatial Workflows:</strong> Understood how wildlife or environmental data can be structured and streamed from the field to the cloud for further GIS analysis or visualization.</li>
